You've probably come here from a link I've sent to build a discord bot. As my account is nearing the maximum amount of bot accounts I have built this tutorial to help you make the application yourself and teach you how to change the name + profile picture of your custom bot.

<div class="text-3xl"> Developer Portal </div>

Head over to the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications" target="_blank"> discord developer portal </a>
\([https://discord.com/developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications)\)

<br>
You will be greeted with an empty page of applications and a big blue "new application" button in the top right corner. Click that button.
<br>

<br>
Name this application whatever you want. This name will only be seen by you.
