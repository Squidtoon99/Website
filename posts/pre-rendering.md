Friskytool is a public discord bot that I built during quarantine. I spent a lot of time into developing, deploying, advertising, analyzing, and scaling the bot's various services.

**Discord** is one of the top voice and text chat services on the web. It handles millions of users daily and has one of the most extensive chat-bot api's on the web. I chose to use it as it was a regular meeting place for my friends and I saw a lot of growth in the service.

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
