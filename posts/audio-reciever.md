With the need for a final project in my computer science 2 class I decided to make an audio reciever. I was a big fan of audio streaming seeing multiple large discord bots handle thousands of audio streams constantly and I wanted to try and build a bare audio streaming client that would interface with youtube's content system.

At the end of a few weeks of constant debugging and testing I made a simple audio playing app that could search, queue, and play high quality youtube videos with ease.
